The `(%s, %s, %s)` placeholders are used in parameterized SQL queries to safely insert user-supplied values into the query. This method helps prevent **SQL injection attacks** by keeping the query structure separate from the data being inserted. Here's how it works:

1. **`%s` placeholders**: These placeholders are replaced by actual values at runtime when executing the query with `cursor.execute()`. For example:
   ```python
   query = "INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade) VALUES (%s, %s, %s);"
   cursor.execute(query, (name, age, grade))
   ```

### Alternatives to `(%s, %s, %s)` for parameterized queries:

1. **Named placeholders (`%(name)s`) in Pythonâ€™s `psycopg2` (PostgreSQL library)**:
   You can also use named placeholders, which make the query more readable.
   ```python
   query = "INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade) VALUES (%(name)s, %(age)s, %(grade)s);"
   cursor.execute(query, {'name': 'John', 'age': 18, 'grade': 'A'})
   ```

2. **`?` placeholders in SQLite**:
   For SQLite, you use `?` as placeholders.
   ```python
   query = "INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade) VALUES (?, ?, ?);"
   cursor.execute(query, (name, age, grade))
   ```

3. **`:name` (Oracle or SQLite)**:
   Some databases, like Oracle and SQLite, support named parameters with a `:` prefix.
   ```python
   query = "INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade) VALUES (:name, :age, :grade);"
   cursor.execute(query, {'name': 'John', 'age': 18, 'grade': 'A'})
   ```

Each method depends on the database you're working with, but the concept remains the same: separating the query structure from the data for security and flexibility.
